That a system which completely alters and even overthrows the whole
view of things prevailing, not merely in common life, but also in the
greater part of the sciences, should encounter, despite the rigorous
demonstration of its principles, a continuing opposition even among
those in a position to feel or really to discern the force of its
arguments, is a circumstance that can be due only to an incapacity for
abstracting from the multitude of individual problems, which, on such an
altered view, the busy imagination at once conjures up from the whole
wealth of experience, so that the judgment is in consequence
distracted and disturbed. We cannot deny the strength of the arguments,
nor do we know of anything certain and assured to put in place of the
principles; but we are afraid of the supposedly monstrous
consequences that are foreseen to follow from them, and despair of resolving
all those difficulties which the principles, in their application, must
inevitably encounter. Nevertheless one may legitimately demand of
anyone who takes any part whatever in philosophical enquiries, that
he be capable of this abstraction, and know how to grasp the principles
in the highest degree of generality, wherein details disappear entirely,
and wherein, if it be only the highest, the solution of all possible
problems is assuredly also contained in advance; and it is therefore natural that in first setting up the system, all enquiries descending into detail should be set aside, and only the first thing needful be done, namely to bring the principles into the open, and to put them beyond all doubt. And by this, indeed, such a system finds the surest touchstone of its truth, that it not only provides a ready solution to problems hitherto insoluble, but actually generates entirely new problems, never before considered, and by a general shattering of received opinion gives rise to a new sort of truth. But this is precisely characteristic of  transcendental idealism, that as soon as it is once admitted, it puts us under the necessity of generating knowledge afresh, as it were, of once more putting to the test what has long since passed as established truth, and, assuming that it stands the test, of at least compelling it to emerge therefrom in a wholly novel shape and form.

Now the purpose of the present work is simply this, to enlarge
transcendental idealism into what it really should be, namely a system of all knowledge. The aim, then, is to provide proof of the system, not merely in general, but in actual fact, that is, through the real extension of its principles to all possible problems in regard to the main objects of knowledge, whether these
have already been raised earlier, but not resolved, or have only now
been rendered possible and have newly come into existence through
the system itself. It follows accordingly that this work must treat of
topics and questions that have simply never been agitated or
articulated among a great many of those who now presume nonetheless
to have an opinion in philosophical matters; inasmuch as they still
halt at the first rudiments of the system, and cannot get beyond them,
either because of an initial incapacity even to understand what the
first principles of all knowledge require, or because of prejudice, or
for whatever other reason. Now although the enquiry does of course
revert to elementary first principles, the above class of persons has
little to hope for from the present work, since in regard to basic
enquiries nothing can be found herein that has not already been said long
since, either in the writings of the originator of the Science of
Knowledge, or in those of the present author; save that in the present
treatment, the exposition in regard to certain points may perhaps
have achieved a greater clarity than it previously possessed—though
even this can never, at any rate, make up for a fundamental want of
understanding. The means, furthermore, whereby the author has
sought to achieve his aim of setting forth idealism in its full extent,
consist in presenting every part of philosophy in a single continuum,
and the whole of philosophy as what in fact it is, namely a progressive
history of self-consciousness, for which what is laid down in experience
serves merely, so to speak, as a memorial and a document. In order
to trace this history with precision and completeness, it was chiefly a
matter, not only of separating exactly the individual stages thereof,
and within these again the individual moments, but also of presenting
them in a sequence, whereby one can be certain, thanks to the very
method employed in its discovery, that no necessary intervening step
has been omitted; the result being to confer upon the whole an
internal coherence which time cannot touch, and which in all subsequent
development remains, as it were, the unalterable framework, to
which everything must be related. The author's chief motive for
devoting particular care to the depiction of this coherence, which is
really a graduated sequence of intuitions, whereby the self raises
itself to the highest power of consciousness, was the parallelism of
nature with intelligence; to this he has long since been led, and to
depict it completely, neither transcendental philosophy nor the
philosophy of nature is adequate by itself; both sciences together are
alone able to do it, though on that very account the two must forever
be opposed to one another, and can never merge into one. The
conclusive proof of the perfectly equal reality of
the two sciences from a theoretical standpoint, which the author has
hitherto merely asserted, is thus to be sought in transcendental
philosophy, and especially in that presentation of it which is contained in
the present work; and the latter must therefore be considered as a
necessary counterpart to his writings on the philosophy of nature. For in
this work it will become apparent, that the same powers of intuition
which reside in the self can also be exhibited up to a certain point in
nature; and, since the boundary in question is itself that of theoretical
and practical philosophy, that it is therefore indifferent, from a purely
theoretical standpoint, whether objective or subjective be made
primary, since this is a matter that practical philosophy (though it has no
voice at all in this connection) is alone able to decide; whence it will
also appear that even idealism has no purely theoretical basis, and to
that extent, if theoretical evidence alone be accepted, can never have
the evidential cogency of which natural science is capable, whose basis
and proof alike are theoretical through and through. Readers
acquainted with the philosophy of nature will, indeed, conclude from
these observations, that there is a reason, lying pretty deep in the
subject itself, why the author has opposed this science to transcendental
philosophy and completely separated it therefrom, whereas, to be sure,
if our whole enterprise were merely that of explaining nature, we
should never have been driven into idealism.

But now as to the deductions which are effected in the present
work from the primary objects of nature, from matter as such and its
general functions, from the organism, etc., there are certainly
idealistic, though not on that account teleological derivations (albeit many
regard them as equivalent), which are as little capable of giving
satisfaction in idealism as in any other system. For supposing I prove, for
example, that it is necessary for the sake of freedom, or for practical
purposes, that there should be matter having such and such properties, or
that the intellect intuit its dealings with the external world as
mediated through an organism, this demonstration continues to leave
unanswered for me the question as to how and by what mechanism the
intellect actually intuits precisely that which is necessary for this
purpose. On the contrary, all proofs that the idealist offers for the
existence of determinate external things must be derived from the
primordial mechanism of intuition itself, that is, by a genuine construction of
objects. Since the proofs are idealistic, the merely teleological
application of them would not in fact advance true knowledge a single step,
since notoriously the teleological explanation of an object can teach
me nothing whatever as to its real origin.

In a system of transcendental idealism as such, the truths of
practical philosophy can themselves emerge only as intervening links,
and that part of practical philosophy actually pertaining to the system
consists only of what is objective therein, and this, in its broadest
generality, is history; a topic that, in a system of idealism, requires to be
deduced transcendentally no less than does the objective of first order,
namely nature. This deduction of history leads directly to the proof
that what we have to regard as the ultimate ground of harmony
between the subjective and the objective in action must in fact be
conceived as an absolute identity; though to think of this latter as a
substantial or personal entity would in no way be better than to posit it in
a pure abstraction—an opinion that could be imputed to idealism only
through the grossest of misunderstandings.

So far as concerns the basic principles of teleology, the reader
will doubtless recognize for himself that they point to the only way of
explaining the coexistence of mechanism with purposiveness in nature
in an intelligible manner. —And finally, with reference to the precepts
concerning the philosophy of art, whereby the whole is concluded, the
author begs those who may have some special interest in this subject
to remember that the whole enquiry, which considered in itself is an
infinite one, is here instituted merely in regard to the system of
philosophy, whereby a multitude of aspects of this immense topic has had
to be excluded from consideration in advance.

The author observes in conclusion that one of his subsidiary
aims has been to provide an account of transcendental idealism that
shall be, so far as possible, generally readable and intelligible; and
that the possibility of some success in this, in virtue of the very
method that he has chosen, is something of which he is already
convinced by a twofold experience in publicly presenting the system.

This brief foreword will be sufficient, nonetheless, to arouse
some interest in the book among those who share the author's
standpoint and seek with him a solution of the same problems, and to
attract those who wish for information and instruction; while those who
are neither acquainted with the one, nor genuinely desirous of the
other, will be scared away from it at the outset; and all its objects will
be thereby achieved.
