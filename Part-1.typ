== Section One: On the Necessity and Character of a Supreme Principle of Knowledge

1. It will be assumed meantime as a hypothesis, that there is indeedreality in our knowledge, and we shall ask what the conditions of thisreality may be. —Whether there is actually reality in our knowledgewill depend on whether these initially inferred conditions can be actually exhibited later on.

#h(1em)If all knowledge rests upon the coincidence of an objective and a
subjective (Introd. §1), the whole of our knowledge consists of
propositions which are not _immediately_ true, which derive their reality from
something else.

The mere putting-together of a subjective with a subjective gives
no basis for knowledge proper. And conversely, knowledge proper
presupposes a concurrence of opposites, whose concurrence can only be a
mediated one.

_Hence there must be some universally mediating factor in our
knowledge, which is the sole ground thereof._

2. It will be assumed as a hypothesis, that there is a system in ourknowledge, that is, that it is a whole which is self-supporting and internally consistent with itself. —The sceptic denies this presupposition, like the first, and like the first it can be demonstrated onlythrough the fact itself. —For what would it be like if even our knowledge, and indeed the whole of nature (for us) were internally self-contradictory? —Let us then assume merely, that our knowledge is a primordial whole, of which the system of philosophy is to be the outline, and renew our preliminary enquiry as to the conditions of such awhole.

#h(1em)Now every true system (such as that of the cosmos, for example)
must contain the ground of its subsistence within _itself_; and hence, if
there be a system of knowledge, its principle must _lie within
knowledge itself_.

3. _There can only be one such principle._ For all truth is absolutely ona par. There may certainly be degrees of probability, but there are nodegrees of truth; one truth is as true as another. But that the truth of all propositions of knowledge is absolutely equal is impossible, if they derive their truth from different principles (or mediating factors); so there can only be one (mediating) principle in all knowledge.

4. This principle is the mediating or indirect principle in every science, but the immediate and direct principle only of _the science of all knowledge_, or transcendental philosophy.

#h(1em)The task of establishing a science of _knowledge_, a science which
puts the subjective first and foremost, immediately compels one
towards a highest principle of all knowledge.

All objections against such an _absolutely_ highest principle of
knowledge are already precluded by the very concept of
transcendental philosophy. They arise merely from this, that the limited nature of
the first task of this science is overlooked; it is a science which
abstracts at the very outset from everything objective, and takes only the
subjective into account.

There is no question at all of an absolute principle of _being_, for
against any such these objections are all valid; what we seek is an
absolute principle of _knowledge_.

But now it is obvious that if there were not an absolute limit to
knowledge—_something_ that, even without our being aware of it,
absolutely fetters and binds us in knowledge, and that, _in the course of our
knowing_ never once becomes an object, precisely because it is the
principle of all knowledge—then we could simply never arrive at
knowledge, even of one solitary thing.

The transcendental philosopher does not ask what ultimate
ground of our knowledge may lie _outside_ the same. His question is,
what is the ultimate _in our knowledge itself_, beyond which we cannot
go? He seeks the principle of knowledge _within knowledge_; (thus it is
itself something that can be known).

The claim that there is a highest principle of knowledge is not a
_positive_ claim, like that on behalf of an absolute principle of being, but
a _negative, limiting_ one, amounting merely to this: There is an
ultimate of some sort, from which all knowledge begins, and beyond which
there is no _knowledge_.

Since the transcendental philosopher (_Introd._ §1) invariably
takes only the subjective as his object, he likewise maintains that it is
only subjectively, that is, _for us_, that there is a _primary knowledge_ of
some kind; whether, in abstraction from us, there is anything else
whatever beyond this _primary knowledge_, he does not initially care at
all, and the sequel must decide it.

Now undoubtedly this _primary knowledge_ is for us the
knowledge of ourselves, or self-consciousness. If the idealist makes
this knowledge into the principle of his philosophy, this is in
accordance with the limited nature of his whole task, which has nothing
for its object beyond the subjective element in knowledge. —That
self-consciousness is the fixed point, to which everything is
attached _for us_, is something that requires no proof. —But that
this self-consciousness might merely
be the modification of a higher being—(perhaps of a higher
consciousness, and this of a higher one still, and so _ad infinitum_)—in a word,
that even self-consciousness might still be something explicable as
such, explicable by something of which we _can_ know nothing, because
the whole synthesis of our knowledge is first made precisely through
self-consciousness—this is something that is of no concern to us as
transcendental philosophers; for self-consciousness is not a kind of
_being_ for us, but a kind of _knowing_, and in fact the highest and most
ultimate that there can ever be for us.

To proceed further, it needs in fact to be proved, and has already
been partly proved above (_Introd._ §1), that even when the _objective_ is
arbitrarily posited as primary, we still never get beyond
self-consciousness. We are then either driven back endlessly in our explanations,
from the grounded to the ground, or we must arbitrarily break the
sequence, by positing an absolute that is both cause and effect—both
subject and object—_of itself_, and since this is initially possible only
through self-consciousness, by again positing a _self-consciousness_ as
primary; this occurs in natural science for which being is no more
fundamental than it is for transcendental philosophy (see my _Sketch of a
System of Nature-Philosophy_, p. 5 [_Sämtliche Werke_, ed. K. F. A.
Schelling (1856-64), 3, 1-268]), and which posits its sole reality in an
absolute that is both cause and effect of itself—in the absolute identity
of the subjective and the objective, which we call nature, and which in
its highest potentiality is again nothing else but self-consciousness.

Dogmatism, for which being is fundamental, can explain things
no otherwise than by an infinite regress; for the series of causes and
effects, by which its explanation proceeds, could be closed only by
something that is at once cause and effect of itself; but by that very
fact it would be transformed into a science of nature, which itself again
reverts on completion into the principle of transcendental idealism. (A
consistent dogmatism is to be found only in Spinozism; but as a real
system Spinozism again can endure only as a _science of nature_, whose
last outcome is once more the principle of transcendental philosophy).

It is evident from all this that self-consciousness circumscribes
the entire horizon of our knowing even when extended into infinity,
and that it remains in every direction the highest principle. Yet for
present purposes we have no need of so commanding a thought, but
only of reflection on the meaning of our first task. —The following 
argument will surely be found intelligible and plain to everyone.

My only concern at the outset is to bring system into my 
knowledge itself, and to seek _within knowledge itself_ for that by which all 
individual knowing is determined. —But now undoubtedly that which
determines everything in my knowledge is the knowledge _of myself_ —
Since I seek to ground my knowledge only _in itself_, I enquire no 
further as to the ultimate ground of this primary knowledge 
(self-consciousness), which, if it exists, must necessarily lie _outside_ knowledge.
Self-consciousness is the lamp of the whole system of knowledge, but it
casts its light ahead only, not behind. —Even admitting that this self-
consciousness were merely the modification of a being independent of
it, a thing that no philosophy, to be sure, can render intelligible, it is
no kind of being for me at present, but rather a _kind of knowledge, and
only in this capacity do I consider it here_. Owing to the limitations of
my task, which endlessly pens me back into the circle of knowledge, it
becomes for me an autonomous and absolute principle—not of all 
being, but of _all knowledge_, since _all knowledge_ (and not only my own)
must start from it. —That knowledge as such, and in particular this
_primary knowledge_, is dependent on something existing independently
thereof, has yet to be proved by any dogmatist. Till now it remains
just as _possible_, that all existence is merely the modification of a 
cognition, as that all cognition is merely the modification of an existent. —
But yet disregarding entirely, and quite apart from the question
whether it is existence that is necessary as such, and knowledge
merely the accident thereof—_for our science_ knowledge is for this 
reason autonomous, that we have regard to it solely as it is grounded _in
itself_, that is, insofar as it is purely subjective.
