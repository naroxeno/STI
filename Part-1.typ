== Section One: On the Necessity and Character of a Supreme Principle of Knowledge

1. It will be assumed meantime as a hypothesis, that there is indeed _reality_ in our knowledge, and we shall ask what the conditions of this reality may be. —Whether there is _actually_ reality in our knowledgewill depend on whether these initially inferred conditions can be actually exhibited later on.

#h(1em)If all knowledge rests upon the coincidence of an objective and a
subjective (_Introd_. §1), the whole of our knowledge consists of
propositions which are not _immediately_ true, which derive their reality from
something else.

The mere putting-together of a subjective with a subjective gives
no basis for knowledge proper. And conversely, knowledge proper
presupposes a concurrence of opposites, whose concurrence can only be a
mediated one.

_Hence there must be some universally mediating factor in our
knowledge, which is the sole ground thereof._

2. It will be assumed as a hypothesis, that there is a system in ourknowledge, that is, that it is a whole which is self-supporting and internally consistent with itself. —The sceptic denies this presupposition, like the first, and like the first it can be demonstrated onlythrough the fact itself. —For what would it be like if even our knowledge, and indeed the whole of nature (for us) were internally self-contradictory? —Let us then assume merely, that our knowledge is a primordial whole, of which the system of philosophy is to be the outline, and renew our preliminary enquiry as to the conditions of such awhole.

#h(1em)Now every true system (such as that of the cosmos, for example)
must contain the ground of its subsistence within _itself_; and hence, if
there be a system of knowledge, its principle must _lie within
knowledge itself_.
#pagebreak()

3. _There can only be one such principle._ For all truth is absolutely ona par. There may certainly be degrees of probability, but there are nodegrees of truth; one truth is as true as another. But that the truth of all propositions of knowledge is absolutely equal is impossible, if they derive their truth from different principles (or mediating factors); so there can only be one (mediating) principle in all knowledge.

4. This principle is the mediating or indirect principle in every science, but the immediate and direct principle only of _the science of all knowledge_, or transcendental philosophy.

#h(1em)The task of establishing a science of _knowledge_, a science which
puts the subjective first and foremost, immediately compels one
towards a highest principle of all knowledge.

All objections against such an _absolutely_ highest principle of
knowledge are already precluded by the very concept of
transcendental philosophy. They arise merely from this, that the limited nature of
the first task of this science is overlooked; it is a science which
abstracts at the very outset from everything objective, and takes only the
subjective into account.

There is no question at all of an absolute principle of _being_, for
against any such these objections are all valid; what we seek is an
absolute principle of _knowledge_.

But now it is obvious that if there were not an absolute limit to
knowledge—_something_ that, even without our being aware of it,
absolutely fetters and binds us in knowledge, and that, _in the course of our
knowing_ never once becomes an object, precisely because it is the
principle of all knowledge—then we could simply never arrive at
knowledge, even of one solitary thing.

The transcendental philosopher does not ask what ultimate
ground of our knowledge may lie _outside_ the same. His question is,
what is the ultimate _in our knowledge itself_, beyond which we cannot
go? He seeks the principle of knowledge _within knowledge_; (thus it is
itself something that can be known).

The claim that there is a highest principle of knowledge is not a
_positive_ claim, like that on behalf of an absolute principle of being, but
a _negative, limiting_ one, amounting merely to this: There is an
ultimate of some sort, from which all knowledge begins, and beyond which
there is no _knowledge_.

Since the transcendental philosopher (_Introd_. §1) invariably
takes only the subjective as his object, he likewise maintains that it is
only subjectively, that is, _for us_, that there is a _primary knowledge_ of
some kind; whether, in abstraction from us, there is anything else
whatever beyond this _primary knowledge_, he does not initially care at
all, and the sequel must decide it.

Now undoubtedly this _primary knowledge_ is for us the
knowledge of ourselves, or self-consciousness. If the idealist makes
this knowledge into the principle of his philosophy, this is in
accordance with the limited nature of his whole task, which has nothing
for its object beyond the subjective element in knowledge. —That
self-consciousness is the fixed point, to which everything is
attached _for us_, is something that requires no proof. —But that
this self-consciousness might merely
be the modification of a higher being—(perhaps of a higher
consciousness, and this of a higher one still, and so _ad infinitum_)—in a word,
that even self-consciousness might still be something explicable as
such, explicable by something of which we _can_ know nothing, because
the whole synthesis of our knowledge is first made precisely through
self-consciousness—this is something that is of no concern to us as
transcendental philosophers; for self-consciousness is not a kind of
_being_ for us, but a kind of _knowing_, and in fact the highest and most
ultimate that there can ever be for us.

To proceed further, it needs in fact to be proved, and has already
been partly proved above (_Introd_. §1), that even when the _objective_ is
arbitrarily posited as primary, we still never get beyond
self-consciousness. We are then either driven back endlessly in our explanations,
from the grounded to the ground, or we must arbitrarily break the
sequence, by positing an absolute that is both cause and effect—both
subject and object—_of itself_, and since this is initially possible only
through self-consciousness, by again positing a _self-consciousness_ as
primary; this occurs in natural science for which being is no more
fundamental than it is for transcendental philosophy (see my _Sketch of a
System of Nature-Philosophy_, p. 5 [_Sämtliche Werke_, ed. K. F. A.
Schelling (1856-64), 3, 1-268]), and which posits its sole reality in an
absolute that is both cause and effect of itself—in the absolute identity
of the subjective and the objective, which we call nature, and which in
its highest potentiality is again nothing else but self-consciousness.

Dogmatism, for which being is fundamental, can explain things
no otherwise than by an infinite regress; for the series of causes and
effects, by which its explanation proceeds, could be closed only by
something that is at once cause and effect of itself; but by that very
fact it would be transformed into a science of nature, which itself again
reverts on completion into the principle of transcendental idealism. (A
consistent dogmatism is to be found only in Spinozism; but as a real
system Spinozism again can endure only as a _science of nature_, whose
last outcome is once more the principle of transcendental philosophy).

It is evident from all this that self-consciousness circumscribes
the entire horizon of our knowing even when extended into infinity,
and that it remains in every direction the highest principle. Yet for
present purposes we have no need of so commanding a thought, but
only of reflection on the meaning of our first task. —The following
argument will surely be found intelligible and plain to everyone.

My only concern at the outset is to bring system into my
knowledge itself, and to seek _within knowledge itself_ for that by which all
individual knowing is determined. —But now undoubtedly that which
determines everything in my knowledge is the knowledge _of myself_ —
Since I seek to ground my knowledge only _in itself_, I enquire no
further as to the ultimate ground of this primary knowledge
(self-consciousness), which, if it exists, must necessarily lie _outside_ knowledge.
Self-consciousness is the lamp of the whole system of knowledge, but it
casts its light ahead only, not behind. —Even admitting that this self-
consciousness were merely the modification of a being independent of
it, a thing that no philosophy, to be sure, can render intelligible, it is
no kind of being for me at present, but rather a _kind of knowledge, and
only in this capacity do I consider it here_. Owing to the limitations of
my task, which endlessly pens me back into the circle of knowledge, it
becomes for me an autonomous and absolute principle—not of all
being, but of _all knowledge_, since _all knowledge_ (and not only my own)
must start from it. —That knowledge as such, and in particular this
_primary knowledge_, is dependent on something existing independently
thereof, has yet to be proved by any dogmatist. Till now it remains
just as _possible_, that all existence is merely the modification of a
cognition, as that all cognition is merely the modification of an existent. —
But yet disregarding entirely, and quite apart from the question
whether it is existence that is necessary as such, and knowledge
merely the accident thereof—_for our science_ knowledge is for this
reason autonomous, that we have regard to it solely as it is grounded _in
itself_, that is, insofar as it is purely subjective.

_Whether it is absolutely_ autonomous can be left undecided, until
such time as the science itself has determined whether anything 
whatever can be thought, which is not to be derived from this knowledge 
itself.
//

Against the task itself, or rather against the definition thereof,
the dogmatist can offer no objection, if only because I quite freely 
restrict my concern, and am only unable freely to extend it to something
which, as will be evident in advance, can never fall within the sphere
of my knowledge, such as an ultimate ground of knowledge beyond all
knowledge. —The only possible objection to our procedure is that the
task so defined is not a philosophical task, and its outcome not 
philosophy.

But what philosophy may be, is precisely the question that has
not so far been agreed upon, and whose resolution can only be the 
outcome of philosophy itself.

We thus maintain, with no less right than the dogmatist in
maintaining the opposite, that what has hitherto been regarded as
philosophy is possible only as a science of knowledge, and has 
knowledge, not being as its object; and that its principle, likewise, can be no
principle of being, but only a principle of knowledge. —Whether we
shall have more success in getting from knowledge to being, in 
deriving everything objective from a knowledge previously assumed as 
autonomous only for purposes of our science, and in thereby raising it to
absolute independence—whether we shall do better in this than the
dogmatist does in the opposite endeavor, of bringing forth knowledge
from a being assumed as independent—the sequel must decide.

5. The first task of our science is to discover whether a passage
can be found from knowledge as such (so far as it is an act) to the 
objective element therein (which is no act, but a being or subsistent); this
task already postulates the autonomy of knowledge, and prior to the
attempt there can be no objection lodged against it.

The task itself therefore postulates at the same time that 
knowledge has an absolute principle within itself, and this principle lying
within knowledge itself is likewise to be the principle of transcendental
philosophy as a science.
But now every science is a body of propositions under a 
determinate form. So if the entire system of science is to be based on this 
principle, it must not only determine the content, but also the form of this
science.

It is generally assumed that philosophy possesses a 
characteristic form, which we call the systematic form. To presuppose this form
without deducing it is acceptable in other sciences, which already 
presuppose the science of sciences, but is not so in that science itself,
which has as its object the very possibility of form as such.

What is scientific form as such, and what is its origin? The 
science of knowledge must answer this question for all other sciences. —
But this science of knowledge is itself already a science, and would
thus require a science of knowledge concerning itself; but this too
would be a science, and so ad infinitum. The question is how we are
to account for this circle, since it obviously cannot be resolved.

This circle unavoidable to science can have no explanation 
unless its original source lies in knowledge itself (the object of the 
science), in the following fashion: that the original content of knowledge
presupposes the original form, and conversely, the original form of
knowledge presupposes its original content, and both are mutually
conditioned by each other. —For this purpose we should require to 
discover in the intellect itself a point at which, by one and the same 
indivisible act of primordial cognition, both content and form are 
generated. The task of finding such a point would be identical with that of
discovering the principle of all knowledge.

The principle of philosophy must thus be one in which content is
conditioned by form, and form in turn by content—not the one 
presupposing the other, but each in reciprocity.—Among other arguments
against a first principle of philosophy, the following is also employed.
The principle of philosophy must admit of being expressed in a 
fundamental proposition: this must assuredly be not just a formal, but a
material proposition. But now every proposition, whatever its content,
falls under the laws of logic. Hence every material principle, merely
by being such, presupposes higher principles, namely those of logic. —
Nothing is wanting to this argument, save that it also be reversed. Let
us consider any formal proposition, say, A = A, as the highest; the 
logical element in this proposition is merely the form of identity between
A and A; but where, then, do I get A itself from? If A exists, it is equal
to itself; but where does it come from? This question can assuredly be
answered, not from the proposition itself, but only from a higher one.
The analysis A = A presupposes the synthesis A. So it is evident that
no formal principle can be thought without presupposing a material
principle, or a material without presupposing a formal one.

From this circle, that every form presupposes a content, every
content a form, there is no escape whatever, unless some proposition
can be found in which form is reciprocally conditioned and made 
possible by content, and content by form.

The first mistaken assumption of the above argument consists,
therefore, in taking the principles of logic to be unconditioned, that is,
derivative from no higher propositions. —But now the principles of
logic arise for us in this way only, that we turn what in other 
propositions is merely form into the actual content of the principles in 
question; thus logic can only arise as such by abstraction from determinate
propositions. If it arises in a scientific manner, it can do so only by abstraction from the highest principles of knowledge, and
since these, as principles, themselves on the other hand already 
presuppose the logical form, they must be such that in them both factors,
the form and the content, reciprocally condition and involve each
other.

But now this abstraction cannot take place until such time as
these highest principles of knowledge are established, and the science
of knowledge is itself brought into existence. This new circle, that the
science of knowledge is at once the foundation of logic, and yet has to
be brought about in accordance with logical laws, is to be accounted for
on the same lines as that exhibited earlier. Since, in the highest 
principles of knowledge, form and content are conditioned by each other,
the science of knowledge must be at once the law and the most perfect
embodiment of scientific form, and be absolutely autonomous in both
form and content alike.

== Section Two: Deduction of the Principle Itself

We are speaking of a deduction of the highest principle. It cannot be a
question of deriving it from one still higher, and certainly not of a
proof of its content. The proof can proceed only upon the dignity of this
principle, or upon proving that it is the highest, and possesses all those
characteristics which appertain thereto.

This deduction can be carried out in many different ways. We
adopt that which, being the easiest, allows us at the same time to 
perceive most immediately the true meaning of the principle.

1. That knowledge as such is possible—not of this or that 
particular thing, but of anything, be it only the knowledge that we know
nothing, is admitted even by the sceptic. If we know anything at all,
then this knowledge is either conditioned or unconditioned. 
—Conditioned?—we know a thing thus, only because it is connected with
something unconditioned. So we arrive in any case at an 
unconditioned knowledge. (That there must be something in our knowledge,
which we do not in turn know from some higher thing, has already
been shown in the preceding section).

The question is thus simply, what it is that we unconditionally
know.

2. I know unconditionally only that of which the
knowledge is conditioned solely by the subjective, not by anything
objective. —Now it is claimed that only a
knowledge expressed in identical propositions is conditioned by the
subjective alone. For in the judgement A = A there is a total 
abstraction from the content of the subject, A. Whether A as such has reality
or not is a matter of entire indifference for this knowledge. And so, if
complete abstraction is made from the reality of the subject, A is 
considered simply insofar as it is posited in us, presented by us; whether
this presentation corresponds to anything outside us is simply not
asked. The proposition is evident and certain, quite regardless of
whether A is something really existing, or merely imagined, or even
impossible. For it says no more than this: in thinking A, I think 
nothing else but A. The knowledge in this proposition is thus conditioned
purely by my thinking (the subjective), that is, as explained above, it is
unconditioned.

3. But in all knowledge an objective is thought of as coinciding
with the subjective. In the proposition A =A, however, no such 
coincidence occurs. Thus all fundamental knowledge advances beyond the
identity of thinking, and the proposition A = A must itself presuppose
such knowledge. —Having thought A, I admittedly think of it as A; but
how, then, do I come to think A in the first place? If it is a concept
freely engendered, it begets no knowledge; if it is one that arises with
the feeling of necessity, it must have objective reality.

Now all propositions in which subject and predicate are linked,
not by the mere identity of thinking, but by something alien to the
thought and distinct from it, are called synthetic; and if so, the whole
of our knowledge consists of nothing but synthetic propositions, and
only therein do we find true knowledge, that is, a knowing that has its
object outside itself.

4. But now synthetic propositions are not unconditioned, self-
evidently certain, for this is the case only with identical or analytic
propositions (cf. 2 above). So if there is to be certainty in synthetic
propositions—and thereby in all our knowledge—they must be traced
back to an unconditional certainty, that is, to the identity of thinking
as such, which is, however, a contradiction.

5. This contradiction would be soluble only if some point could
be found in which the identical and the synthetic are one, or some
proposition which, in being identical, is at once synthetic, and in being
synthetic, is at once identical.

In every synthetic judgement, A = B, a wholly alien
objective coincides with a subjective; the predicate, the concept,
always stands here for the subjective, and the subject term for
the objective; and how we can
attain to certainty in regard to such propositions is unintelligible,

a) unless something, as such, is absolutely true. For if our
knowledge involved an endless regress from principle to principle,
then in order to arrive at that feeling of compulsion (the certainty of
the proposition), we should have, unconsciously at least, to run
through that unending series backwards, which is obviously absurd.
If the series is genuinely without end, there can be no way of running
through it. If it is not, then there is something absolutely true. —If
there is such, then our whole knowledge, and every single truth in
what we know, must be involved with that absolute certainty; the 
covert feeling of this connection is responsible for that sense of 
compulsion we have in taking any proposition to be true. —It is the task of
philosophy to resolve this covert feeling into overt concepts, by 
exhibiting the connection in question, and the major linkages therein.

b) This absolute truth can only be an identical piece of 
knowledge; but now since all true knowing is synthetic, the absolute truth,
for all it is an identical cognition, must necessarily also be at the same
time a synthetic one; so if there is such a truth there must also exist a
point at which the synthetic springs directly from the identical 
cognition, and the identical from the synthetic.

6. In order to solve the problem of finding such a point, we must
undoubtedly enter more deeply into the contrast between identical and
synthetic propositions.

In every proposition two concepts are compared together, that
is, they are either set equal or unequal to each other. Now in identical
propositions the thought is compared merely with itself. —The 
synthetic proposition, on the other hand, goes beyond the mere thought; in
thinking the subject of the proposition, I do not also think the 
predicate; the latter is annexed to the subject. Thus the object here is not
merely determined by the thought of it; it is regarded as real, since
anything is real that cannot be brought about merely by thought.

Now if an identical proposition is one in which concept is 
compared only with concept, while a synthetic proposition is one in which
the concept is compared with an object distinct from itself, the task of
finding a point at which identical knowledge is at the same time 
synthetic amounts to this: to find a point at which the object and its 
concept, the thing and its presentation, are originally, absolutely and 
immediately one.

That this task is identical with that of finding a principle of
all knowledge, can be still more briefly

shown as follows. —There is absolutely no explaining how 
presentation and object can coincide, unless in knowledge itself there exists a
point at which both are originally one—or at which being and 
presentation are in the most perfect identity

7. Now since presentation is the subjective, while being is the
objective, the task, in a nutshell, consists of finding the point at which
subject and object are immediately one.

8. By this even more exact delimitation of the problem, it is now
as good as solved. This unmediated identity of subject and object can
exist only where the presented is at the same time that which presents,
where the intuited is also the intuitant. —But this identity of 
presenter and presented occurs only in self-consciousness; it is here,
therefore, that the desired point has been found.

== Elucidations

a) If we now look back at the principle of identity, $A = A$, we find that
we could immediately derive from it our own principle. —In every
identical proposition, so we claimed, a thought is compared with itself,
which assuredly takes place by an act of thinking. The proposition $A = A$ therefore presupposes a thinking which immediately becomes its
own object; but an act of thinking that thus becomes an object to itself
occurs only in self-consciousness. There is admittedly no seeing how
one could pluck something real out of a proposition of logic purely as
such; but it is possible to see how, by reflection on the act of thinking
in this proposition, one might discover something real, for instance
categories, from the logical functions of judgement, and thus the act of
self-consciousness, from every identical proposition.

b) The fact that, in self-consciousness, the subject and object of 
thinking are one, can only become clear to anyone through the act of self-
consciousness itself. What is involved here, is that one should 
simultaneously undertake this act, and in so doing should again reflect upon
oneself. —Self-consciousness is the act whereby the thinker 
immediately becomes an object to himself, and conversely, this act and no
other is self-consciousness. —This act is an exercise of absolute 
freedom, to which one can certainly be directed, but not compelled. —The
ability to intuit oneself therein, to discriminate oneself as thinker and
as thought, and in so discriminating, again to acknowledge oneself as
identical, will be constantly presupposed in what follows.

c) Self-consciousness is an act, yet by every act something is brought
about in us. —Every thinking is an act,
and every determinate thinking a determinate act; yet by every such
act there originates for us also a determinate concept. The concept is
nothing else but the act of thinking itself, and abstracted from this it is
nothing. The act of self-consciousness must likewise give rise to a 
concept for us, and this is nothing other than that of the self. In becoming
an object of myself through self-consciousness, there arises for me the
concept of the self, and conversely, the concept of the self is merely the
concept of becoming-an-object-to-oneself.

d) The concept of the self arises through the act of self-consciousness,
and thus apart from this act the self is nothing; its whole reality 
depends solely on this act, and it is itself nothing other than this act.
Thus the self can only be presented qua act as such, and is otherwise
nothing.

Whether the external object may be nothing distinct from its
concept, whether here too concept and object are one, is a question
that has first to be decided; but that the concept of the self, i.e., the act
whereby thinking as such becomes its own object, and the self itself
(the object) are absolutely one, is in no need of proof, since apart from
this act the self is obviously nothing, and exists as such only in this act.

Thus we have here that original identity of thought and object,
appearance and reality, for which we were searching, and which is 
nowhere else to be found. The self simply has no existence, prior to that
act whereby thinking becomes its own object, and is thus itself nothing
other than thinking becoming its object, and hence absolutely nothing
apart from the thought. —That this identity between being-thought
and coming-to-be, in the case of the self, remains hidden from so
many, is due solely to the fact that they neither perform the act of self-
consciousness in freedom, nor are able to reflect in so doing upon what
arises therein. —As to the first it should be noted that we assuredly
distinguish self-consciousness, qua act, from merely empirical 
consciousness; what we commonly term consciousness is something that
merely continues along with presentations of objects, and maintains
identity in the flux of presentations; it is thus of a purely empirical
kind, in that I am thereby aware of myself, certainly, but only as a
subject of presentations. —But the act here under discussion is one
whereby I am aware of myself, not with this determination or that, but
originally, and this consciousness, in contrast to the other, is called
pure consciousness or self-consciousness.

The genesis of these two types of consciousness can be
further elucidated as follows. On abandoning oneself entirely to
the involuntary succession of presentations, these latter, however
manifold and diverse they may be,
will still appear as belonging to a single identical subject. If I reflect
upon this identity of the subject among its presentations, there arises
for me the proposition '/ think'. It is this 'I think' which accompanies
all presentations and preserves the continuity of consciousness 
between them. —But if we free ourselves from all presentation, so as to
achieve an original self-awareness, there arises—not the proposition J
think, but the proposition 'I am', which is beyond doubt a higher 
proposition. The words 'I think' already give expression to a 
determination or affection of the self; the proposition 7 am', on the contrary, is
an infinite proposition, since it is one that has no actual predicate,
though for that very reason it is the locus of an infinity of possible
predicates.

e) The self is nothing distinct from its thinking; the thinking of the
self and the self as such are absolutely one; thus the self is nothing
whatever beyond the thinking, and hence is not a thing or affair, but
rather the unendingly nonobjective. This must be understood as 
follows. The self is indeed an object, but only for itself, and is thus not
originally in the world of objects; it first becomes an object by making
itself into an object, and does not become one for anything external,
but always only for itself.

Everything else, that is not self, is originally an object, but for
that very reason is so, not for itself, but for an intuitant outside it.
The originally objective is always merely a known, never a knower.
The self becomes a known only through its knowing of itself. —Matter
is said to be without self, precisely because it has no inwardness, and
is apprehended only in the intuition of another.

f) If the self is not a thing or affair, it is likewise in vain to enquire
about any predicate thereof, for it has none, save only this, that it is
not a thing. The character of the self consists in this very fact, that it
has no other predicate than that of self-consciousness.

The same result can now be derived from other angles as well.

That which is the highest principle of knowledge cannot have
the ground of its cognition in something higher still. Hence, for us too,
its principium essendi and principium cognoscendi must be one, and
coincide in a unity.

For that very reason, this unconditioned cannot be sought in
any kind of thing; for whatever is an object is also an original object
of knowledge, whereas that which is the principle of all knowledge
can in no way become an object of knowledge originally, or in itself,
but only through a specific act of freedom.
