= General Deduction of Transcendental Idealism

== Introductory

1. Idealism has already been formulated in our first principle. For
since the self, in being thought, immediately also _exists_ (seeing that it
is nothing else but the thinking of itself), the proposition $self = self$ is
equivalent to the proposition / am, whereas the proposition $A = A$ says
only: if $A$ is posited, it is posited equal to itself. The question, is it
then posited? simply cannot be asked of the self. Now if the
proposition 'I am' is the principle of all philosophy, there cannot indeed be any
reality save what is equivalent to the reality of this proposition. But
the latter does not say that I exist for anything outside me, but only
that I am _for myself_. Hence everything that exists at all will be able to
do so only for the self, and there will be no other reality whatsoever.

2. The most general proof of the overall ideality of knowledge is
therefore that carried out in the _Science of Knowledge_, by immediate
inference from the proposition I am. There is yet another proof of it
possible, however, namely the factual, which in a system of
transcendental idealism is carried out in the very process of actually deducing the
entire system of knowledge from the principle in question. Now since
our concern here is not with a science of knowledge, but with the
system of knowledge itself, according to the principles of transcendental
idealism, we can therefore merely state the general result of the
science of knowledge, so that, starting from the point thus specified, we
may begin our deduction of the aforementioned system of knowledge.

3. We should proceed forthwith to the establishment of theoretical and
practical philosophy as such, were it not that this division itself
requires prior deduction by the science of knowledge, which is by nature
neither theoretical nor practical, but both of these at once. So we shall
first have to demonstrate the necessary opposition between theoretical
and practical philosophyâ€”the proof, as given in the science of
knowledge, that they each presuppose one another, and that neither is
possible without the other, in order that we may then erect upon these
general principles the system covering both.
